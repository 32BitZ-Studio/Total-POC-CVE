## Vulnerability Overview

**CVE-2025-62215** is a Windows Kernel privilege escalation vulnerability:

- **Type**: Elevation of Privilege (EoP)
- **CVSS Score**: 7.0 (High)
- **Root Causes**: 
  - Race condition in kernel resource synchronization (CWE-362)
  - Double-free memory corruption (CWE-415)
- **Impact**: Local authenticated users can escalate to SYSTEM privileges
- **Status**: Actively exploited zero-day (patched in November 2025)

## Technical Details

### Vulnerability Mechanism

1. **Race Condition**: Multiple kernel threads access shared resources without proper synchronization
2. **Timing Window**: Attackers exploit the timing window to manipulate kernel operations
3. **Double-Free**: After winning the race, a double-free bug is triggered, causing heap corruption
4. **Privilege Escalation**: The heap corruption is leveraged to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges

### Affected Systems

- Windows 10 (multiple versions)
- Windows 11 (multiple versions)
- Windows Server editions

## Build Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019 or later with Windows SDK
- Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for kernel components (optional, for advanced features)
- Administrator privileges for testing (on test systems only)

## Compilation

```bash
# Build the main exploit
cl.exe /EHsc /O2 exploit.cpp /link /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE /OUT:exploit.exe

# Build the advanced exploit module
cl.exe /EHsc /O2 advanced_exploit.cpp /link /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE /OUT:advanced_exploit.exe

# Build system info utility
cl.exe /EHsc /O2 system_info.cpp /link /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE /OUT:system_info.exe

# Or use the provided build script
build.bat
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the PoC (requires local authentication)
exploit.exe

# With verbose output
exploit.exe --verbose

# Test mode (safer, won't attempt full exploitation)
exploit.exe --test
```

## Mitigation

- Apply Windows security updates from November 2025 or later
- Enable kernel-mode hardware-enforced stack protection
- Monitor for suspicious privilege escalation attempts
